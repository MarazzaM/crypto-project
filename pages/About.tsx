        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
        cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
        double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on
        blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate
        network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that
        they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them
        theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
